# Multiply

There is a long-standing tradition on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) where every "initiate" must be able to at least debug a poorly-written `multiply` function which multiplies two numbers together before being able to sign up for Codewars and become a true Codewarrior.  This code example serves as a reminder that I shall add Fortran support to Codewars one day through a pull request in [their CLI repo](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli).
